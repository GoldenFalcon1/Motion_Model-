# Motion_Model-
To complete this exercise fill in the motion_model function which will involve:

For each x_{t}xt.:

Calculate the transition probability for each potential value x_{t-1}x t−1	
 
Calculate the discrete motion model probability by multiplying the transition model probability by the belief state (prior) for x_{t-1}x t−1
	
 Return total probability (sum) of each discrete probability
